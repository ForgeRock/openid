<h3>OAuth2</h3>

<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">The OAuth 2.0 standard</a>
   defines four oauth flows</p>

   <dl>
       <dt><em>The Authorization Code Flow</em></dt>
       <dd>
           <p>The Authorization Code Flow is the default flow and most secure Oauth flow.
           For using this flow, the client should be able for secure storage of the ClientID and ClientSecret.
           Client applications with the code running in the server side can use this flow.</p>

           <p>Try the <a href="authorizationCode/index.html">The Authorization Code Flow</a>.</p>
       </dd>

       <dt><em>The Implicit Flow</em></dt>
       <dd>
           <p>The Implicit flow is designed for application that can't store the client secret. It is specially the
           case for applications with the code running in the client side, like javascript.
               This flow is less secured as the client identity won't be check. Therefore, the access token generated
               with this flow will have a short expiration time.
           </p>

           <p>Try the <a href="implicit/index.html">Implicit flow</a>.</p>
       </dd>

       <dt><em>The Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow</em></dt>
       <dd>
           <p>This flow is used when the resource owner can entrust the password to the client. You can only use this flow
           with OpenAM if the authentication chain you want to use accept credential in the format username, password.
           If you're using a chain with HOTP, this flow won't fit.</p>

           <p>Try the <a href="password/index.html">Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow</a>.</p>
       </dd>

       <dt><em>The Client Credentials Flow</em></dt>
       <dd>
           <p>The client flow is used when the client is also the resource owner. It is usually the case if for example,
               you have your mobile application and your web application and you want to configure oauth2 between the two.
           </p>

           <p>Try the <a href="clientCredential/index.html">Client Credentials Flow</a>.</p>
       </dd>
   </dl>

<p>The examples provided here are both written in JavaScript. Neither aims to
   protect anything, but instead to show you the steps that each kind of client
   follows, and the responses from OpenAM as OpenID Connect Provider.</p>
