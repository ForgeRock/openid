<h3>OpenID Connect Client Profiles</h3>

<p><a href="http://openid.net/connect/" target="_blank">OpenID Connect 1.0</a>
   defines two client profiles.</p>

   <dl>
       <dt><em>Basic Client Profile</em></dt>
       <dd>
           <p>The Basic Client Profile is designed for web-based relying
           parties that use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant type,
           such as server-side clients that can protect their client
           credentials.</p>

           <p>Try the <a href="basic.html">Basic Client Profile</a>.</p>
       </dd>

       <dt><em>Implicit Client Profile</em></dt>
       <dd>
           <p>The Implicit Client Profile is designed for relying parties
           that use the OAuth 2.0 Implicit grant type, such as browser-based
           clients written in JavaScript.</p>

           <p>Try the <a href="implicit.html">Implicit Client Profile</a>.</p>
       </dd>
   </dl>

<p>The examples provided here are both written in JavaScript. Neither aims to
   protect anything, but instead to show you the steps that each kind of client
   follows, and the responses from OpenAM as OpenID Connect Provider.</p>

<h3>OpenID Connect Dynamic Registration</h3>

<p>OpenID Connect 1.0 defines mechanisms both to discover the provider
   configuration, and also to register client applications dynamically.</p>

<p>See the <a href="register.html">example registration page</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Mobile Connect - Experimental</h3>

<p>
  Try OpenAM 12.0.0 as an OpenID Provider and Authenticator for
  <a href="http://gsmamobileeconomy.com/gsmamc/"
